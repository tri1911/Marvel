## Marvel
An app allows user to discover interesting information about Marvel comics, characters, events and so on. From this project, I gained experience with Apple's interesting framework. Moreover, I integrated some UIKit stuffs into this project. Although I met some challenges with UIKit integration, I overcame and learnt a lot of useful tricks from it.

## Things I learned 
- Experience about Reactive programming with Combine Framework
- How to working with data (Serialization and Deserialization)
- Fetch data from RESTful API using URLSession
- Data persistence with CoreData (store favorite contents) and caching data with UserDefaults
- Better understanding MVVM architecture
- Design and implement User Interface with SwiftUI
- Learn how to integrate UIKit's features (WebView and UINavigationController) using UIRepresentable/UIControllerReperentable protocol
- Learn about using protocol and class inheritance to generalize many kinds of similar data model
- Learn some useful tricks to implement infinity scrolling list and scroll to top button
- Integrate third library (SDWebImage) with Swift Package Manager

## Technology Used
